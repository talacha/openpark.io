## Iterations

### Iteration 1 — implement plan from scratch (2026-10-21T13:13Z, ~9h20m into run)

**Previous review flagged:** none (first iteration; no review-verdict.json existed).

**What changed (per the 7 acceptance criteria + plan.md):**
- **Criterion 5 / seed (plan item 1):** `provisionTenant()` in `apps/api/src/services/tenants.ts` now seeds
  `passPolicy.overstayCharge` off the tenant **currency** (`c.currency === 'MXN' ? 500000 : 0`) instead of the
  country code. Behaviour is unchanged for today's country set (MX→MXN→500000, US→USD→0) but intent now matches
  "keyed off currency, default only, configurable policy — no new enforcement."
- **Criterion 5 / messaging (plan item 2):** the three 12h overstay bodies (`overstay_guest/host/staff`) in
  `apps/api/src/notify/messages.ts` now append a localized "move the vehicle" instruction in every catalog
  (en, es-MX, es-ES via spread, pt-BR, fr, de, ar). The `{amount}` stays currency-formatted from the policy
  value; the 10h/11h `reminder` body is untouched. es-MX keeps `$5,000.00` + `plataforma del HOA`.
- **Criterion 1 / share (plan item 3):** added `qrGifDataUrl`, `dataUrlToBlob`, `passShareMessage` helpers to
  `apps/web/src/pass.ts` and a **Share pass** button in `apps/web/src/screens/Resident.tsx` (Web Share API with
  the QR as an image file; degrades to text-only share, then clipboard + image download; never throws;
  `role="status"` aria-live feedback). New locale keys `res.share/shareTitle/shareBody/shareCopied/shareFailed`
  added to all 7 web locale files with identical placeholders.
- **Criterion 2 / prefill (plan item 4):** `usePass()` in `apps/web/src/screens/Attendant.tsx` now pre-fills
  `flow.plate` (via new pure `passPrefillPlate()` helper) when a scanned pass carries a plate hint; keypad/camera
  stay available to correct it. No hint → plate left blank as before.
- **Tests:** extended `apps/web/test/pass.test.ts` (4 new cases) and `apps/api/test/passes.test.ts` (12h bodies
  contain the move-vehicle phrase; 10h reminder does not; USD tenant seeds overstayCharge 0).

**Lowest-risk decision recorded:** the verification gate was RED on a clean checkout of HEAD before any of my
changes — `apps/api/test/api.test.ts > reports the cash taken per attendant for a site-local day` failed because
`session_event.server_at` defaulted to the DB wall-clock (`now()`), while the rest of the system (and the test)
drive business time via the mocked `app.now()`. With the machine's real date at 2026-10-21 and the test
hard-coding `date=2026-10-20`, payment events fell outside the day window. Honest, lowest-risk fix (not a test
weakening): stamp `session_event.server_at` from the authoritative app clock when the caller has it — threaded
`app.now()`/`now` through `addEvent`/`recordPayment` and their call sites in `services/sessions.ts`,
`services/passes.ts`, `routes/sessions.ts`. In production `app.now() === now()`, so no behavioural change; it
only aligns audit/report timestamps with session timestamps and makes the day-bucketed report deterministic. No
assertion was changed to accommodate it.

**Gate status:** GREEN.
- `pnpm --filter @openpark/core build` → ok
- `pnpm typecheck` → 7 projects Done, no errors
- `pnpm test` → core 36, sdk-ts 6, marketing 9, web 55 (+1 pre-existing skip), api 99 — all pass
- `pnpm --filter @openpark/web check:css` → "logical properties only"
